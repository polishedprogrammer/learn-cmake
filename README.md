# Polished CMake

Polished CMake is a collection of example programs and their
accompanying CMake build systems. Please see [Polished
Programmer](https://polishedprogrammer.com/) for related
articles. These examples go hand-in-hand with the website to teach you
how to create build systems for your projects using excellent
tools. You will be to create your build systems in less time and
support a more comprehensive set of development environments, all with
a single set of readable instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository onto your local machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/polishedprogrammer/polished-cmake.git

This repository contains several examples, each in a separate
subdirectory. To build an example, navigate to its subdirectory and
run the following commands unless you find more specific
instructions. Some projects have their own README.md file:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

These commands will generate a build system and compile the
project. You can then run the example by executing the compiled
executable.

## Contributing

If you have an example program with a CMake build system that you
would like to contribute to this repository, please fork the
repository and submit a pull request with your changes. We welcome
contributions from anyone who would like to help others learn how to
use CMake effectively.
