# Polished CMake

Polished CMake is a collection of example programs and their accompanying CMake build systems designed to teach others how to effectively create their own build system generators. The examples in this repository are designed to help you understand how CMake can be used to generate build systems for a variety of languages and environments.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository onto your local machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/polished-cmake.git

Each example in the repository is contained in a separate subdirectory, along with its own CMakeLists.txt file. To build an example, navigate to its subdirectory and run the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

This will generate a build system for the example program and compile it. You can then run the example by executing the compiled executable.

## Contributing

If you have an example program with a CMake build system that you would like to contribute to this repository, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. We welcome contributions from anyone who would like to help others learn how to use CMake effectively.
